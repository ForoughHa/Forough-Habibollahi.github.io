      <p>Currently, I am a full-time data scientist and computational neuroscience postdoctoral research fellow at <a href="https://corticallabs.com/">Cortical Labs</a>. We are a start-up company and have 
            created DisBrain which fuses living brain cells onto computing devices to create machines with biological intelligence. Our in-vitro neuronal cultures can learn to play the game of 'Pong'!
       <br>     
      <p>Prior to that, I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://ndl-lab.org/"> Neural Dynamics Laboratory</a>, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Melbourne Brain Center, <b>University of Melbourne</b>, Melbourne, Australia. I worked on Calcium Imaging Recordings from freely behaving mice recorded using Miniscopes to study the emergence of criticality
          in hippocampal neural ensembles during a cognitive task compared to the rest state.

      I am also a part-time data scientist at <a href="https://corticallabs.com/"> Cortical Labs</a>, aiming to study the live biological neurons integrated with traditional silicon computing in terms of the variations in the system's distance from criticality as well as the information content stored
            in the in-vitro neural ensembles during rest and while embeded in the game environment of 'pong'.

<p> Before arriving to Melbourne, I was undertaking M.Sc. courses at the school of life sciences at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/"> École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (<b>EPFL</b>)</a>, while also working as a student researcher under the supervision of Prof. Johannes Graff and Dr. Bianca Ambrogina Silva in the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/bmi/">Brain Mind Institute</a> (<b>BMI</b>) </p>
<p>
Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology. As an undergraduate student, I was eager to grasp opportunities to involve in professional research in early stages of my research career.</p>
<p> 
During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Prof. Subburaj Karupppasamy in the <a href="https://med.sutd.edu.sg/subburaj">Medical Engineering and Design Laboratory</a> at Singapore University of Technology and Design (<b>SUTD-MIT</b>). </p>
  <p> 
I also had the experience of doing remote research with Prof. Alex Fornito and Dr. Nigel Rogasch at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/turner-institute"> </b>Turner Institutefor Brain and Mental Health</b> </a>, <b>Monash University</b> in a project to develop a MATLAB toolbox for serial communication with Magventure as well as 2002, BiStim2, and Rapid2 Magstim transcranial magnetic stimulators.</p>
